# Roadmap

Keep this current. At the end of every session, update **Next up** so the next (cloud) session can start straight away.

## Next up
Owner's order (2026-10-24):
1. [x] Set up the project: `package.json`, TypeScript strict, Vitest, ESLint (with the sibling's purity rule), Prettier, `npm run check`. Next.js is added with the UI (Phase 3).
2. [x] KB parts done so far (database, backend) as versioned JSON with Zod validation.
3. [x] Scratch calibration turned into committed tests: golden scenarios, property test 8 (all 15,625 combinations), type-win coverage; `npm run calibrate` reproduces every number in the calibration log.
4. [x] KB test: a score of 5 or 1 needs a non-GK source; unsourced extremes held at 3 and marked `unsourced`.
5. [ ] **Part 3 (languages)**, then re-run the backend calibration with the language part instead of the stand-in. Source `type-safety` there (Gin, Spring Boot, ASP.NET Core 5s are held at 3 until then).
- **Owner:** SQLite "Appropriate uses" check (rule D9 stays unverified); Q28 (public domain and "open source only").
- Keep retrying Q21 facts each session, especially TechEmpower (every backend `performance` 5 is unsourced) and the Stack Overflow 2026 framework numbers.
- Later option (owner): replace D3's −30 with a hard rule "document can't be #1 for highly connected data".

## Phase 0: Plan (status: done 2026-10-23)
- [x] Repo, doc skeleton, references folder; owner added 4 books + 8 links, all indexed
- [x] Study Architecture Advisor; summary in `SIBLING_PROJECT.md`
- [x] `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` for the kickoff brief
- [x] Open questions answered by the owner (2026-10-23): Q2–Q19, Q24, Q25 decided
- [x] Research log with checked dates (`RESEARCH.md`); session 2 verified WebSockets, runtimes, free-tier terms from vendor repos
- [x] KB schema, scoring engine, testing strategy (13 golden scenarios, owner-approved with G3 fix and G13 added)
- [x] `TECH_STACK.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the app itself (Q8)

## Phase 1: Knowledge base (status: started 2026-10-23)
- [x] `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_DRAFT.md` part 1: **database** (types, 7 products, rules D0–D9, first calibration: all database expectations hold)
- [x] Part 2: **backend** (types, 10 products, rules B0–B3, first calibration: all backend expectations hold within the team's language) (2026-10-24)
- [x] Owner review of part 1 (2026-10-24): D3 document −30 (G10), D9 SQLite rule (unverified), Q26 and Q27 decided
- [ ] Part 3: language (incl. team-skill rules T1–T5)
- [ ] Part 4: frontend
- [ ] Part 5: hosting (needs the Q21 free-tier facts verified)
- [ ] Compatibility relations (`compatibility.json` draft) and bundles/glossary
- [ ] Scoring rubrics finalised (Q20); second sources for flagged comparative scores
- [x] Project set-up, KB as versioned JSON + Zod, validation tests (schema, sources, 5-or-1 evidence, stale facts, type-win coverage) for database and backend (2026-10-24); Next.js scaffold with the UI
- [ ] Fairness lint (vendor-only comparative scores)

## Phase 2: Rule engine
- [ ] Pure scoring: weights, two levels, rules, skills, stack assembly; test-first
- [ ] Golden scenarios G1–G13 passing; property tests

## Phase 3: UI
- [ ] Form (situation, team skills, constraints, locks, priorities), result page (stack, per-part lists, comparison table with "checked on" dates, not-needed parts)
- [ ] `?style=` hand-off; link from Architecture Advisor (Q2)

## Phase 4: AI layer
- [ ] Bounded adjustments (±5, max 3, top 5 per part) + explanation; server re-runs assembly; fallback chain; rules-only mode

## Phase 5: Launch
- [ ] Deploy on Vercel Hobby, README, about/methodology pages (sources, fairness rules, refresh dates)
- [ ] First KB refresh session scheduled (every 3 months, Q7)

## v1.1 (decided order)
1. **Backend-as-a-service: Supabase and Firebase** ranked as a backend type (Q13; popular with students)
2. Database hosting ranked under hosting (Q18); reconsider SQL Server (Q17)
3. ORM → authentication → caching/queues → mobile (Q4)
